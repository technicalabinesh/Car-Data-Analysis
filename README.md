# 🚗 Car Data Analysis Using Python

Analyze automobile data to uncover trends in pricing, fuel types, mileage, transmission preferences, and much more — helping manufacturers, buyers, and analysts understand the dynamics of the car market.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing a car dataset to extract insights regarding:

- 💰 Car pricing patterns  
- ⛽ Fuel efficiency and engine specifications  
- ⚙️ Transmission types and their market presence  
- 🧾 Manufacturer-wise trends  
- 🗓️ Vehicle age and depreciation

The project utilizes **Python's data science libraries** for cleaning, exploration, and visualization.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing on raw car data  
- Explore how **price** is affected by mileage, fuel type, transmission, and brand  
- Identify top-selling or most-listed car brands/models  
- Analyze **depreciation** patterns based on year  
- Visualize fuel economy trends and transmission distribution

## 📊 Data Preprocessing

✔️ Converted year to car age  
✔️ Standardized categorical variables  
✔️ Cleaned noisy values and fixed data types  
✔️ Handled missing and duplicate entries  
✔️ Removed outliers in price and mileage

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

🛣️ **Kms Driven vs. Selling Price** – Understand depreciation with use  
💡 **Fuel Type Analysis** – Compare price ranges across Petrol, Diesel, CNG, Electric  
⚙️ **Manual vs Automatic** – Which transmission has higher resale value?  
🏷️ **Top Brands** – Identify most common car makes  
📆 **Vehicle Age Impact** – Do older cars depreciate linearly?

## 📌 Key Insights

🚘 **Newer cars (under 5 years)** retain more value  
⛽ **Diesel cars** often priced higher than Petrol, but trend is shifting  
⚙️ **Automatic cars** generally cost more but are less common  
💸 Cars driven over **100,000 km** show steep price drops  
🏷️ **Maruti, Hyundai, and Honda** are top listed brands in resale markets

---

## 💡 Future Enhancements

✨ Predict car prices using **machine learning models**  
✨ Build an **interactive price estimator app** using Streamlit  
✨ Add web scraping to update listings in real-time  
✨ Analyze **region-wise** trends if location data is available
